<div class="header"> Tutorials and Seminar papers</div>

<div class="sub-header">Seminar.</div>
<p>Seminars and tutorials are a vital part of most academic courses and give you an opportunity to discuss topics and issues with other students, teaching assistants and members of academic staff. This sort of critical debate and argument is very useful in developing your grasp and understanding of your subject. Benefits associated with seminars and tutorials. </p>
<p><u> Seminars and tutorials include opportunities to:</u></p>
  <li> Apply knowledge from your lectures and background reading.</li>
  <li> Solve problems in a team to maximise your creativity.</li>
  <li> Test your understanding and develop new insights.</li>
  <li> Learn from other people‚Äôs approaches and ideas.</li>
  <li> Clarify any concepts that you might not have understood.</li>
 <div class="sub-header">Preparation.</div>
 <p>Preparing a tutorial or seminar presentation can be an overwhelming experience if you allow it to be one. The strategies and steps below are provided to help you break down what you might view as a large job into smaller, more manageable tasks.</p>
 <p><u>For  a effective tutorial or seminar presentation  You will need to:</u></p>
   <li>Gather relevant information by consulting the appropriate literature.</li>
   <li> Plan how you will use the allotted time focus on the essential points.3. .</li>
   <li> Delivering your talk and remove any padding organise the material into a meaningful order..</li>
   <li> The presentation must also contain an identifiable introduction, body and conclusion.</li>


<div class="sub-header">Content and organisation.</div>
<p>You must select a content or organization that is of interest to the audience and to you. It will be much easier to deliver a presentation that the audience finds relevant, and more enjoyable to research a topic that is of interest to you.</p>
<p>The presentation must also contain an identifiable introduction, body and conclusion.</p>
  <li>The introduction: Introduces you, your topic (or question) and what will be covered in the talk.</li>
  <li>The body: Explains main points, key issues and/or arguments and provides enough detail and examples to illustrate and support these .</li>
  <li>The conclusion: Restates the main points, and may make further recommendations.</li>


<div class="sub-header">Delivery.</div>
<p>Most people spend hours preparing a presentation but very little time practicing it. When you practice your presentation, you can reduce the number of times you utter words and phrases like, "um," "well," and "you know." These habits can easily diminish a speaker's credibility. You can also fine-tune your content to be sure you make your most important points in the time alloted.</p>
<p>In addition to planning the content of your presentation, you need to give advanced thought to how you want to deliver it. Do you want to commit your presentation to memory, use cards to guide you, or read from a script? Or, you might want to use a combination of methods. To help you decide, read the advantages and disadvantages of the four delivery methods described below.</p>
<p><u>Important Tips:</u></p>
  <li>Speaking from Notes: Many people like to speak from notes. Typically these notes are either on cards or paper in outline form and contain key ideas and information. If you are using an electronic presentation tool, you may be able to include your notes in the presentation itself. The benefit of delivering a presentation from notes is that you sound natural rather than rehearsed and you can still maintain relatively good eye contact with the audience. The down side is that you might not express your key ideas and thoughts as well as you may have liked had you planned your exact words in advance.</li>
  <li>Speaking from Memory: A distinct advantage of speaking from memory is your ability to speak to the audience without relying on notes or a script. This allows you the flexibility to move away from the podium and to maintain eye contact with the audience. However, speaking from memory has disadvantages, too. Presentations from memory often sound rehearsed and the possibility exists that you'll forget an important point, present information that's inaccurate, or completely lose your train of thought. If you decide to deliver your presentation from memory, have notes handy to jog your memory just in case!</li>
  <li> Speaking from Text: Speaking from text involves writing your speech out, word for word, then basically reading from the text. As with speaking from memory, an advantage of this method is that you plan, in advance, exactly what you're going to say and how you're going to say it. A disadvantage is that you might appear to the audience to be stiff or rehearsed. You will need to make frequent eye contact and speak with expression to maintain the audience's interest.</li>
  <li>Using a Combination of Methods: You may find the best method to be a combination of all three. For instance, experts suggest you memorize the first and last ten minutes of your talk so that you can speak flawlessly and without notes. Notes may be suitable for segments of your presentation that you know very well, for example, relating a personal story. Finally, speaking from a text might be appropriate when you have quotes or other important points that you want to make sure you communicate accurately and completely. You can make a smooth segue to written text by saying something like: "I want to read this quote to you verbatim, to ensure that I don't distort the original intent."</li>
  <li> .</li>

<div class="sub-header">Review.</div>
<p>After your tutorial is finished it is absolutely essential that you take some time to review your tutorial session or seminar. This will help you when you come to finish writing up the written version of your presentation.</p>
<p><u> Ask yourself the following questions:</u></p>
  <li>did you get your main argument across?</li>
  <li> how do you know that?</li>
  <li> what responses did members of the audience make?</li>
  <li> what questions did they ask?</li>
  <li> what suggestions or criticisms did they offer?</li>
  <li> how can you make use of their suggestions and criticisms?</li>
  <p>By answering these questions you can incorporate the answers, where appropriate, into the final draft of the written version of your tutorial or seminar presentation if this is required.</p>
